## The "Mutable Algorithms in Immutable Languages" series

* [Part 1](http://tel.github.io/2014/07/12/mutable_algorithms_in_immutable_languges_part_1/) where we introduce the problem of mutable algorithms in immutable languages by exploring Union/Find.
* [Part 2](http://tel.github.io/2014/07/13/mutable_algorithms_in_immutable_languages_part_2/) where we find models of mutable memory which can be executed purely or impurely in Haskell.
* [Part 3](http://tel.github.io/2014/07/15/mutable_algorithms_in_immutable_languages_part_3/) where we fix a crucial bug in the pure implementation from part 2 by reflecting on the need for border control between "regions" of mutable memory and, finally, finally, introduce `ST` as the final solution.
